## Abstract

Existing retail channels have been optimized to push items through the supply chain and deliver them to the customers. However, the rise of e-commerce and its associated benefits, such as easy returns and circular economy opportunities, have created a problem for retailers who have not adapted to this reverse flow. As a result, the process of recovering items from customers is often manual and inefficient.

The Loop co. is developing LoopOS, a circular economy framework, to solve this problem. LoopOS integrates different aspects of the circular economy, such as product submission, validation, delivery, certification, refurbishment, and re-entry into the market, into a single, decentralized, and collaborative ecosystem.

This thesis explores the development process and implementation of two critical components within the LoopOS environment: LoopOS Onboarding, which focuses on simplifying the onboarding process for new users within the LoopOS platform while also automating their environment creation within LoopOS, and LoopOS UI, designed to standardize and enhance front-end development across various LoopOS applications. The former addresses challenges in asset pipelines and front-end development. It ensures seamless integration and modularity for LoopOS developers, enabling them to focus on core functionality rather than front-end complexities. The LoopOS UI significantly contributes to the modular architecture, providing a solid foundation for implementing a new user interface in LoopOS applications.

In conclusion, this thesis achieves its stated objectives and showcases a comprehensive approach to software development, from planning and execution to innovation and future vision. The implemented solutions contribute to the ongoing development of the LoopOS platform, highlighting the adaptability, collaboration, and problem-solving skills crucial in a dynamic software development environment.
